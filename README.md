[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alphagov/verify-frontend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alphagov/verify-frontend)

The frontend for GOV.UK Verify

## Installing the application

Once youâ€™ve cloned this then `bundle` will install the requirements.

## Running the application

You can start the application without having any of the closed source components installed with:

`./startup.sh --stub-api`

This will start the frontend server running on http://localhost:50300/ and a stubbed API server on http://localhost:50199.

To start a journey on the front end visit http://localhost:50300/test-saml and click `saml-post`.

If you're on the Verify team and have the rest of the federation running locally you should omit the `--stub-api` argument
and start your journey from the test-rp.

## Running the tests

`./pre-commit.sh`

This will [lint the application code](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-lint) and run the tests.

If you need to run the javascript-enabled tests that require a browser, you will need to have Chrome installed. The stable release of Chrome should work.

## Editing .travis.yml

If you plan to edit this file please enable the pre-commit check which lints it, preventing mistakes.
To do so, first install [pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com) and then run `pre-commit install`.
On an OSX system this amounts to:

```bash
brew install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
